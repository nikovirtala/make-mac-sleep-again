# Make Mac Sleep Again

The script `make-mac-sleep-again.sh` in this repository modifies the Mac OS power management settings in a way that the computer does not wake up during the sleep to check notifications or such.

Script is tested with MacOS High Sierra 10.13 but it should work also with MacOS Sierra 10.12.

+ Disable `Power Nap`
+ Enable `Do Not Disturb` when the display is sleeping
+ Disable `Wake for Wi-Fi network access`
+ Disable `Darkwake`
